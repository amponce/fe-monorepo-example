## Material Icons

The material icons are available at <https://material.io/resources/icons>

To add an icon, find it at <https://material.io/resources/icons>

Download the svg files for each type (Filled, Outlined, ...) and open the files to find the `path d=""` section.
Copy the path into the `index.ts` file for the corresponding type as a named export (use `ma` + the icon name as the export).

Add the icon to the main export at the bottom of the `index.ts` file.
